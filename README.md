# Numbers

This repository contains custom Haskell implementation of various numerical data types, such as natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers.

## Natural Numbers

The natural numbers, operations on them, and ordering are based on [Peano Axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms).

## Integers

We place an equivalence relation on the set of ordered pairs of natural numbers so that

    (a, b) ~ (c, d) if and only if a + d = b + c.

We can then define integers as equivalence classes with respect to the above relation.

## Rational Numbers
